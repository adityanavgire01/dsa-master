Pick a pivot: Choose any element from the array. Often, the last element is used for simplicity, but you can choose any element.

Partitioning: Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot are on its left, and elements greater than the pivot are on its right.

Recursion: Recursively apply the same steps to the subarrays of elements to the left and right of the pivot.
